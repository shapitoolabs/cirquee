Cirquee is a React Native boilerplate template with Expo, TypeScript, Storybook, and other features. It is a highly opinionated boilerplate that contains everything I personally need to start working on a mobile application. It can do everything and yet nothing. It provides a simple configuration and clear TODOs. The processes for starting the development of an application no longer need to be done over and over again. It strives to use all the latest technologies and practices so that it does not become outdated but remains well usable.

And why the name Cirquee? Because until now, developing a new application was a big circus for me. I had my own specific package for each application, in which I worked. Complete chaos, mess, and circus. Cirquee changes this and creates order in the chaos.

## Features

### Absolute Imports

Clean code and code writing easier.
Preconfigured by default.

### Conventional Commits

Configured with [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to automatically validate commit messages following the [conventional-commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard.

**fix**: Fixes a bug that improves functionality without adding new features.
**feat**: Adds a new feature or significantly expands an existing one.
**build**, chore, ci: These types relate to tools and processes such as build scripts, project maintenance, or integration.
**docs**: Updating or adding documentation.
**style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, whitespace, etc.).
**refactor**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature, but improve the code structure.
**perf**: Enhances code performance.
**test**: Adding or fixing tests.

### TS-Reset | Extremely Strict Typescript

TypeScript's default type declarations may have imperfections, but [ts-reset](https://github.com/total-typescript/ts-reset) enhances them.

### Patch Package

Configured with [patch-package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package) to patch dependencies as needed.
For eg: `npx patch-package package-name`

### Bundle Analyzer

Configured with [react-native-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/react-native-bundle-visualizer)</br>
Run `yarn analzye:bundle` which generates bundle map and show you what's inside of your react-native bundle

### Auto Sort Imports

Automatically organize imports on file saves. Be sure to enable on your user settings for better experience.

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
},
```

### T3 Env

Configured with [t3-oss/env-core](https://github.com/t3-oss/t3-env).
Typesafe environment variables management integrated along with [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).

    return <TweetCell item={item} />;
  }}
  estimatedItemSize={50}
  data={tweets}
/>;
```
